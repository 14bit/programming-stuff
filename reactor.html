  <h2>Personal Mapping Project</h2>

  <hr>

  <p1>Reactor is a map for the game Team Fortress 2 that I began
    work on in September of 2015. It was originally designed for
    the <a href="https://tf2maps.net/posts/343411/"> TF2maps.net Dynamic Control
      Point Contest.</a> I designed the layout and gameplay, and a user known as
      Corvatile stepped up to do the artpass of the map. When the contest ended,
      it somehow managed to get 5th place. Since then I have repeatedly attempted
      to continue work on the map, but I never could figure out how to fix the
      major player flow issues and would give up each time. However, I recently had a
      breakthrough and have begin major renovations of the map.

    This is a bunch of filler text that will someday be replaced
     with an actual article describing the creation of the map. I think it
     would be fun to actually write up about the design process of each of my
     maps and the iterations they went though, but now's not the time. I want to
     finish this so I can go back to working on Reactor!

     HTML is fun and I've used it a bit in the past, but it's very time consuming.
     I used to not like Bootstrap because flexboxes worked fine for my uses,
     but I've begun to see its' uses like this fancy carousel thing and the fancy
     collapsing navbar. And hey, I even managed to get a canvas that stays
  centered but still shrinks when the window gets too small!</p1>

  <p1>This is a bunch of filler text that will someday be replaced
   with an actual article describing the creation of the map. It's not all just
   random filler though, I changed this sentence compaired to the exact copy scattered
  around just to add a bit of variety and make it look better. I wonder if anyone will
   actually notice that this one is different. I want to
   finish this so I can go back to working on Reactor!
